# UMAP for R

This is work in progress for developing the *uniform manifold approximation and projection* (UMAP) in R ([Original Python repo here](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap)). The goals are to implement a backend for UMAP in C++ and use R as an interface.

UMAP is a powerful tool for data-visualization and non-linear dimensionality reduction.

I welcome collaboration.
